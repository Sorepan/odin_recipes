This is just a guided project, I wouldn't say I pretend to do this entirely by myself.
With this practice I would want to practice the use of git and github to manage a project versions, and to continue with The Odin Project course. Also, I want to refresh some concepts about HTML.
I used AI to avoid problems with the recipes, because I relly don't know how to cook anything.
